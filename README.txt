Weather Prediction And Forecasting

This machine learning model is designed to forecast the weather based on historical weather data (Seattle). 
The model uses a supervised learning algorithm called Random Forest to predict the weather based on input features such as precipitation, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and wind speed.

The accuracy of the model currently is 83.78%
The accuracy of the model can be furthur increased by feeding more data to the model by training and tuning the hyperparmeters.
